## 1) Overview of System Functionality
A single static HTML page (`index.html`) that displays required student/course fields and a simple "Hello, World!" message. Designed to be responsive and accessible; no external libraries.

## 2) Deployment Instructions (Used)

- Enabled **GitHub Pages** under **Settings → Pages**, source: *Deploy from a branch*, branch: `main`, folder: `/ (root)`.
- Verified the site at the Pages URL from a phone and a laptop.

## 3) Known Issues / Assumptions
- Assumes Pages is enabled for the repository and the branch/folder are set correctly.
- Initial propagation may take up to a couple of minutes after enabling Pages.
- If using a custom theme/Jekyll, ensure `index.html` is not overridden by a layout.

## 4) Source Code Files
- `index.html`
- `README.md`
- `SUBMISSION.md` (this file)
